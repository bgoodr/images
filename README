These images are intended to be small images I use for avatars and
things, not large images. If I were to add a large fileset to GitHub,
I would exhaust my 300MB budget and would have to pay more for it.

uscas6_90px_x_51px.png was taken from
http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/u/us%7Dcas6.gif and scaled down to
90x51px in Gimp to fit avatar restrictions on some forum sites.
